# Description of Dataset
## Internal Phylogeny of Assamiidae
Assamiidae represents a highly diverse family of daddy longlegs (Arachnida: Opiliones) within the suborder Laniatores. They possess poorly resolved internal systematics based on historically bad species descriptions throughout the 1930's, making morphological classification difficult. 

### Included Taxa
Specimens were collected across Australasia and sampled from natural history collections including Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology and the Mus√©um d'histoire naturelle in Geneva. 59 sequenced specimens were included in subsequent analyses. 9 additional specimens were included from the dataset constructed by Giribet et al. 2010. 

Outgroup taxa represent sequences of two Beloniscidae and 11 Pyramidopidae. 

### Included Genes/Loci/Markers
DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing yielded partial fragments of:
-two mitochondrial protein-coding genes: 16S rRNA and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I
-one nuclear protein-encoding gene: histone H3
-two nuclear ribosomal genes: 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA

# Quality Control
Dataset was provided cleaned and aligned from Prashant Sharma and Luciano Palmieri-Rocha. See the alignments under data/ in the folder "1_Sequence alignments".

Sequences were assembled and cleaned using Geneious 9.1.8.
Consensus sequences were submitted to BLAST against NCBI database to identify contaminations.
